Reason I have Choosen this Problem is, This is very Challenging in terms of Thinking large Numbers and their Square | `1389019170` | **3 hours to understand and look through**, ***an hour to write the code***

# to Run the Solution:
First checkout the code in your local computer and run the following command on your project terminal.
```
 python Concealed_Square_206.py

```
# Running the Euler No 35 .
```
The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

How many circular primes are there below one million?

Reason I have Choosen This problem is, Prime Number solutions are one of the popular math problem. and its very logical to think in coding prespective | `55` | **1 hour to understand and look through**, ***1.5 hr to write the code***

# To Run the Solution for Circular Prime Numbers

go to the Poject folder in Command line and Run Node
```
node Circular_prime_35_node_version.js
```

### Alternatively You can run the Circular Prime numbers in a browser as follow:
. run the Following  Command on your terminal
```
node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server

```
Then Access bellow address on your Browser to run the HTMl file.
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
and use circular_prime.html to run.



### Project Euler Problem No. 31
```
In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).
It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

    1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
```

The Reason I have choosen This was i wanted to work on a problem which involves Permutations and Combinations. | `73682` | **2 hour to understand and look through**, ***30 min to write the code***

# to Run the Solutions:
```
node coin_sums_31.js
```
