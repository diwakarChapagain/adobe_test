# Running the Euler No 206. Concealed Square
```
Find the unique positive integer whose square has the form 1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_0,
where each “_” is a single digit.
```
# to Run the Solution:
First checkout the code in your local computer and run the following command on your project terminal.
```
 python Concealed_Square_206.py

```
# Expected Outcome : ``` 1389019170```

# Running the Euler No 35 .
```
The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

How many circular primes are there below one million?
```
# To Run the Solution for Circular Prime Numbers

go to the Poject folder in Command line and Run Node
```
node Circular_prime_35_node_version.js
```
#Expected outcome is ```55```

### Alternatively You can run the Circular Prime numbers in a browser as follow:
. run the Following  Command on your terminal
```
node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server

```
Then Access bellow address on your Browser to run the HTMl file.
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
and use circular_prime.html to run.



### Project Euler Problem No. 31
```
In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).
It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

    1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
```

#to Run the Solutions:
```
node coin_sums_31.js
```
# Expected Outcome : ```73682```
